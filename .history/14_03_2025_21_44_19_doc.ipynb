    "Fig. 1 shows that there is no obvious linear relationship between hours played and either age or experience. Most participants are clustered near 0 hours, while a handful of outliers report much higher played hours. The figure also indicates that the majority of players are between about 15 and 28 years old. Interestingly, Fig. 2 suggests that regular players have the highest average played hours, followed by amateurs, pros, beginners, and finally, veterans. I found this surprising as I assumed that more experienced players (pros and veterans) would play more hours. However, the outliers in Fig. 1 may explain why the regular and amateur players’ average hours were so high: several regulars have between 150–250 hours, and one amateur has around 150 hours, which greatly increases the overall average for both of those groups. Fig. 3 shows that non-binary players tend to have the highest total hours, followed by female, agender, male, those who did not prefer to answer, then other, and two-spirited participants."

KNN does not have many assumptions beyond the idea that observations close together in the multi-dimensional space formed by predictor variables (age and experience) have similar response variables, KNN does not have many assumptions. I will center and scale both predictors so that age and experience contribute equally to distance calculations. \n",

    "To find the best number of neighbors K, I will perform 5-fold cross-validation on the training set and select the K that minimizes the RMSE. The range of K's I will test will be from 1 to 10 because (). I will use 5-fold becausse it is small enough to be computational efficient and beacuse the dataset with only 196 observations is small, so splitting too much will (), but 5 is also big enough to estimate model performance. Through this, I can compute the average RMSE for each K. After selecting the best K, I will finalize the model with the best K and evaluate how well it predicts the testing data based on the RMSPE."
