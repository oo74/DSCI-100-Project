    "The players.csv file contains 196 observations, each representing a unique player. 7 variables capture the demographic information and skill level of each player. Many players report zero hours of gameplay, but it is unclear whether it is because they are new or simply uninterested in playing. This distinction is important in the context of making predictions. For example, if 18-year-olds normally game a lot, but have few played hours because they only recently joined the study, it could skew the predicted played hours for similar age individuals. In addition, if the \"experience\" variable is self-reported, then designations may be subjective and unreliable as predictors.\n",

    "Fig. 1 shows that there is no obvious linear relationship between hours played and either age or experience. Most players are clustered near 0 hours, while a few outliers report much higher played hours (150+). The figure also indicates that the majority of players are between about 15 and 28 years old. Interestingly, Fig. 2 suggests that regular players have the highest average played hours, followed by amateurs, pros, beginners, and finally, veterans. I found this surprising as I assumed that more experienced players (pros and veterans) would play more hours. However, the outliers in Fig. 1 may explain why the regular and amateur players’ average hours were so high: several regulars have between 150–250 hours, and one amateur has around 150 hours, which greatly increases the overall average for both of these groups. Finally, Fig. 3 shows that non-binary players tend to have the highest total hours, followed by female, agender, male, those who preferred to not answer, other, and two-spirited participants, with the last three groups having means close to 0 hours."

    "## (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the response variable is numeric, I will use regression to predict players' played hours from their age and experience level. More specifically, because there are no clear linear relationships (Fig. 1), KNN is more suitable than linear regression. KNN does not have many assumptions beyond the idea that observations close together in the multi-dimensional space formed by predictor variables (age and experience) have similar response variables. The dataset being small (196 observations) also makes it compatible with KNN. I will split 75% of the data into a training set and reserve the remaining 25% as a test set, giving the model sufficient data to learn on while still leaving enough unseen data for a reliable performance evaluation. For pre-processing, I will center and scale both predictors so that age and experience contribute equally to distance calculations. I will use 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to find the K that minimizes RMSE, since relying on a single split can produce misleading results if, by chance, it happens to be unrepresentative of the overall data. I will test K values from 1 to 10 because the dataset is relatively small, meaning larger K values are likely to underfit it. 5-fold has a good balance between computational efficiency and generating stable estimates, especially given that we only have 196 observations; creating more folds would risk producing very small training subsets and unstable performance estimates. After identifying the best K, I will finalize the model using that value and evaluate its prediction quality on the test set via RMSPE."
