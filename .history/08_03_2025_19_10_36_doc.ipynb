    "## (1) Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"players\" dataset provides profiles of the players, including demographic information and skill level. It has 196 observations, each of which represents a different player. Its 7 variables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Type | Description |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| experience | chr | level of experience the player has with gaming |\n",
    "| subscribe | lgl | whether the player is subscribed to the game's associated newsletter  |\n",
    "| hashedEmail | chr | player's email encrypted as a code |\n",
    "| played_hours | dbl | no. of hours the player has played the game |\n",
    "| name | chr | player's first name |\n",
    "| gender | chr | player's gender |\n",
    "| Age | dbl | player's age |\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, who are the people in the players database? Also, I've noticed that many of them have 0 hours of gameplay, and I'm curious why that is. On that note, when was this data collected? Is the 0 played hours a consequence of the player being new, or that they've been registered for a while, but did not want to play? Because I thinkn that could definitely affect the interpretation of data if we're looking at player characteristics to predict what demographic we should market to. For example, maybe we neglect X demographic because the players in the dataset with X trait generally have 0 hours of play, but what if those in the dataset are just new, so they didn't have time to accumulate the game time? Also, how is the level of experience assessed? First of all, the scale itself is very vague––for example, how would one distinguish between whether they are beginner or amateur. Second, if it is self-indicated, there is not much objectivity in this label assignment, so using experience as a predictor for another variable or vice versa may be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"sessions\" dataset describes the start and end time of each gaming session, as well as the email associated with the player that started the session. It has 1535 observations, each of which represents a gaming session. Its 5 variables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Type | Description |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| hashedEmail | chr | player's email encrypted as a code |\n",
    "| start_time | chr | when the player begins the gaming session |\n",
    "| end_time | chr | when the player ends the gaming session |\n",
    "| original_start_time | dbl | start time for the gaming session as milliseconds that has passed since January 1st, 1970 (Unix epoch time)|\n",
    "| original_end_time | dbl | end time for the gaming session as milliseconds that has passed since January 1st, 1970 (Unix epoch time) |\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not really sure what the time zone used for start_time and end_time are; if we were to use that data to compute the time windows players are most active, we would need to know the time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I am also curious about how this data obtained. Was it obtained from the existing players in the study? Was it through a survey? If so, was it optional, or mandatory (e.g. as a part of sign up)? Because if it was optional, it won't result in a dataset representative of the true population, which can result in inaccurate predictions.\n",
